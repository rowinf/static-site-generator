# Static site generator
A guided project for boot.dev static site generator

## Getting started
This is a static site generator. It converts Markdown text from files in the `/content` directory into html. 
It inserts the converted html into a designated spot in `template.html`. It also copies files from `/static` into the `public/` directory.
The `public/` directory can then be copied to a web server as a nice little website.

The script for doing this is `main.sh`
